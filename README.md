## Overview
This repository contains analyses of weather data for Oahu, Hawaii. The intent was to determine the viability of a recreational business at different seasons of a given year.

## Results
The analysis showed that:
- The average temperature in December was slightly lower than June
- The minimum and maximum temperatures in December were slightly lower than June
- There was slightly more variation in temperature in December compared to June

## Summary
Overall, the difference in temperature between June and December is not substantial and will not strongly affect the viability of the business. Oahu is therefore a sutiable location for the business. To further determine suitability, I would inspect and plot both temperature and rainfall for more recent years for various locations across the island.
